🗑️ Smart Waste Management System

A real-time IoT-based smart waste monitoring system that uses sensors and a Python-Flask backend to track bin fill levels, environmental data, and provide alerts — all visualized via a responsive dashboard.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📡 Real-time sensor data (fill level, temperature, humidity, moisture)
- 📊 Live charts and analytics
- 🛑 Tamper, overfill, and temperature alerts
- 💾 Data logging with SQLite
- 🧠 Automatic daily report generation
- 🔌 Arduino integration (via serial communication)
- 🌐 Web dashboard using Flask + Socket.IO

🚦 How It Works
Arduino reads sensor data and sends JSON via serial port

Python backend reads data, stores it, and emits real-time updates using Socket.IO

Flask serves a dashboard that shows live charts and alert notifications

Would you like me to:
- Generate a sample `requirements.txt`?
- Help you deploy it online (e.g., Render or Railway)?
- Add badges to the top of the README (e.g., Python version, license)?

Let me know!
